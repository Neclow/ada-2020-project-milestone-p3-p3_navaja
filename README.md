Improve the methods and/or the analyses done in the paper:
* Neural networks
* XGBoost, LightGBM (Extreme gradient boosting methods)
* Clustering (t-SNE)?

Propose and analyze a different dataset with which you could answer similar questions as the replicated paper:
* Something with American election?
* Predict other wars...

Propose answering additional research questions with the dataset used in the paper:
* Could take countries that had civil wars --> try to predict if it will happen the next year given data on previous years (RNNs)? 

Do better on oob data 9/20 for random forest
Pb use model with interpretable parametres otherwise useless

Part 2: 

Dependance of the predictive parameters on the area (continent/aire culturelles)
Voir plus refined separé les données par continent
Interpreter les differences de parametres

Part 1: 

Train best ever predictor:
* Neural networks
* XGBoost, LightGBM (Extreme gradient boosting methods)
* Clustering (t-SNE)?

* Could take countries that had civil wars --> try to predict if it will happen the next year given data on previous years (RNNs)? 
      * Use the probability of CW in the previous year as a feature.
      
Part 3:

Exploration of time dependency ?
