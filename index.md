# What's at stake
A civil war is defined as a conflict between different groups of a single state or country. Such wars can have serious repercussions like resourcesÂ´ consumption, crowd movement, or destruction of infrastructures. Besides, most of these conflicts imply international intervention -they represented two thirds of the 138 intrastate conflicts between the end of World War II and 2000 [[1]](#1). Thereby, understanding the dynamics leading to these rare events happens to be crucial. It would allow to anticipate and even to prevent civil wars in the years to come.  

# What has already been done to predict civil war onset 
Recent advancements in data science have catalyzed the development of predictive models for various problems, including political conflicts such as civil wars [[2]](#2) [[3]](#3) [[4]](#4). In 2015, Muchlinski _et al._ published a paper _Comparing Random Forest with Logistic Regression for Predicting Class-Imbalanced Civil War Onset Data_. They used Random Forests to try predicting rare events in conflict data more accurately. 
In this project, we first aim at benchmarking these results against other common machine learning algorithms, namely neural networks and gradient boosted trees. As the geographical area was an important feature in the abovementioned study ("Western Europe and US Dummy" in Fig. 4 [[5]](#5)), we will examine whether predictions differ when training separate models for each continent or subregion. Finally, we will explore whether civil war events can be forecast as time series instead of simple regression points, e.g., using autoregressive models.

# Stretching the limits of previous analysis 
## Data wrangling
Before diving into the analysis, we first cleaned and organized the dataset. The latter is in civil war data (CWD), which consists in many features measured annually for each recognized country in the world from 1945 to 2000 [[4]](#4). We loaded the 88 variables indicated by Muchlinski et al. [5] together with the response variable (1 if a civil war event occured in a given country-year, 0 otherwise) and columns with country-year information, and cleaned the resulting dataset for the rest of the notebook.
A necessary cleaning step for our analysis was to correct the geographical dummy variables. These variables describe whether a country is in a given geographical area or not. For the data of the year 2000, their values suddenly differed from the previous years. Therefore, we simply corrected them by imputing the same values as the previous year.
Once the dataset cleaned, we started the analysis.

## Comparing machine learning algorithms for civil war onset classification.
In this section, we used the same features than Muchlinski _et al._ [[5]](#5) minus the features related to geographical area separation (e.g., "Western Europe and US Dummy"). Indeed, we investigated the effect of data aggregation by continent/subregion in a subsequent analysis (cf. **4.2**). To ensure a meaningful comparison, the same training and testing sets were used to assess each tested algorithm.
### Defining the models
Here, we benchmarked the results obtained by Muchlinski et al. [[5]](#5) with Random Forests against two other machine learning algorithms: multi-layer perceptrons and gradient boosted trees (XGBoost). 
* **Multi-layer perceptrons** is a class of feedforward artificial neural network (ANN). The idea is to have layers of 'neurons' connected to each other with weights adjusted during the learning process. The output of each neuron layer, which is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs, is transmitted to the next layer. This model is occasionnally used to create mathematical models by regression analysis. Classification being a particular case of regression when the response variable is categorical, itvappears that multi-layer perceptrons make good classifier algorithms. As we explore civil war onset classification, evaluate the performance of this model thus seems promising.
* **XGBoost** uses decision trees to produce a prediction model. It is a a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems. Such an algorithm is usually used to learn to rank. Thus, since this part of the project consists in ranking the parameters that best indicate the probability of a civil war onset in a given country, using XGBoost could prove to be interesting.
### Evaluating the performance of the models
For each model, we performed hyperparameter optimization through cross-validated grid-search. Model performance was then evaluated on 15% of the dataset using three metrics: ROC-AUC and F1 scores as in Muchlinski et al. [[5]](#5), and also the area under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC). Although normally suited for binary classification, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (Sensitivity vs. 1 - Specificity) is less informative for imbalanced problems with a few positive examples [[6]](#6). Indeed, while recall is equivalent to sensitivity, specificity cannot capture data skew as well as precision.
2 hyperparameters were tuned for each model:
We tuned 2 hyperparameters for each model:
 * Random Forests:
     * _max_features_: the number of features to consider to build the tree splits, namely either <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sqrt D"> or <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\log(D)">, with <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=D"> the number of features.
     * _max_samples_: the number of samples to draw from the feature matrix to build each tree, namely either two-thirds or the entirety of the _N_ samples
  
 * XGBoost:
     * _max_depth_: maximum depth of a tree, namely either 3, 6 (default) or 9
     * _subsample_: the number of samples to draw from the feature matrix to build each tree, namely either two-thirds or the entirety of the _N_ samples
  
 * Multi-layer perceptron:
     * _alpha_: the amount of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=L_2"> regularization
     * _hidden_layer_sizes_: the number of hidden layers, namely either 4 or 8 (the width of the hidden layers was set to the number of features)

As the data is heavily imbalanced (approximate positive-negative ratio = 1:100), downsampling of the majority class was performed. The sampling strategy was also optimized through grid search as different positive-negative ratios were explored (1:7, 1:3 and 1:1).

### Result analysis 

_INCLUDE IMAGES_

Looking at the ROC-AUC results, it seems that the implemented multi-layer perceptron (MLP) performed worse than tree-based methods, as both Random Forests and XGBoost achieved similar scores.
That said, F1 and PR-AUC scores tell a different story with respect to Random Forests' predictive ability. Looking at these metrics, it seems XGBoost was far more robust at predicting civil events than Random Forest. The confusion matrices plotted above confirm this observation, as XGBoost was able to correctly classify 15 out of 20 civil war events, while Random Forests and MLP respectively predicted 9 and 5 civil war events.
Concerning the tree-based methods, these observations are in accord with corrections of Muchlinski et al. [[5]](#5)'s findings by Wang [[7]](#7), who found a substantial difference in PR-AUC between Random Forests and gradient boosted trees (such as XGBoost) on a similar dataset.
Overall, XGBoost was the best model for this task. In addition to its sheer rapidity, this algorithm has become increasingly popular for its performance in a variety of machine learning challenges [[8]](#8)[[9]](#9).

_INCLUDE IMAGES_

Feature importance was evaluated via **permutation importance**, which evaluates the mean decrease in a given metric (here, average precision) when permuting the feature values.
In the figures above, we observe that the tree-based decision methods (Random Forests and XGBoost) have similar feature importances. In particular, primary commodity export features, exports of goods and services, fuel exports, the relative amount of trade and the relative amount of military manpower are the top-6 features in both models.
Contrary to the mean decrease in Gini score, this method is robust to feature cardinality. Hence, it is not surprising to observe that some political indicators (e.g., the Polity index or a dummy variable describing whether the state is semi-federal) that were surprisingly absent in Muchlinski et al.'s model [5] are present in the most important features of Random Forests and XGBoost. In spite of this, both methods share a fair amount of important variables with those of Muchlinski et al.'s model [5] (e.g., primary commodity export features, trade, military power, infant mortality, illiteracy).
On the other hand, the multi-layer perceptron captures a lot more political indicators in its most important features, the top-3 features concern the "political structure" of the country (1. Whether it is a new state or not, 2. whether it is a federal state or not, 3. Polity annual change). That said, the trade-related features that were critical in the tree-based models are also present in top 10-20 features of the MLP.


## Effect of spatial data separation
Following the importance of the "Western Europe and US Dummy" variable in Muchlinski _et al._ [[5]](#5), we decided to aggregate the data by subregions, and to see whether predictive accuracy differs when fitting the models separately on each group. We then analyzed feature importance to see whether different variables can explain better civil war events in different geographical areas.

 ## Predicting civil war onset as time series forecasting
In this section, we considered that each subregion is assigned to a time series of civil war/peace events. This part of the project aimed at seeing whether civil war events could be forecast given past data using simple time forecasting models (e.g., autogressors (AR) or ARIMA).
